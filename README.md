# ToDo
Hello Viewer! Welcome to my Git Repository ToDo. 
A lot of people have done this project. Many people approached many different methods and styles to develop this. But, I never liked any of them. So, I made one for myself for fun and In here I present it to you with a joy. I am feeling that no one will ever do this like me. 
I would love to know what you, as a viewer has to say about my project. Be sure to check it and share it with your friends(if you like to, Just show them or them, you don't really have to share)!
